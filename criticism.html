According to our interpretation of this story, these said characters are in fact spirits of the dead. Since there was a  scene in the library wherein the librarian finds a 10 year old newspaper. The following remark appears during this scene: " In the photograph the bodies are lined up in pine boxes, disfigured by shrapnel, but they were still recognizable to me. A shroud of blood spreads over the cobblestones, Laura dressed in white, her hands crossed over her open chest". This implies that Laura has been dead for now atleast 10 years. This begs the question, how is the character still able to communicate with Laura despite the circumstances that Laura is already a spirit. It can be concluded that Laura, as well as the rest of the characters, possibly are spirits who have already been dead for 10 years.</p></div>

Including, Spanish Civil War in (1936 - 1939),  Spanish American War (April 21 to December 10,1898) and War of the Spanish Succession (1701 - 1714). With this written in their history, the author Carlos Ruiz Zafon may have taken this as his inspiration to write "Kiss" with its main character evidently experiencing trauma from the last war. Though it wasn't indicated in the story if the main character was directly involved in a war. Moreover, the main character's background also wasn't told.</p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">The story intentionally leaves many details about the protagonist, such as his backstory and name. This deliberate vagueness encourages readers to fill in the gaps with their imagination and understanding of the text. 

     Another interesting detail is that the story is told through an unreliable narrator whose perspective cannot be trusted. This is evident in the protagonist's uncertain recollection of events. He questions his own actions, stating, "I believe we had some words. The wrong kind. My kind. I believe I pushed him. Down the stairs. Hard." This doubt casts uncertainty on the reliability of his narrative.

     Additionally, the protagonist's distorted perception of reality further undermines his credibility. He didn't know that the tower he inhibits is in ruins, which suggests that he perceives things differently from the people around him. All these mentioned factors are what make the readers doubt the credibility of the story told by the narrator.</p></div>
