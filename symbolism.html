Before moving in, the protagonist experienced homelessness and the harshness of life on the streets. To him, the tower was a beacon of paradise, starkly contrasting his previous life, despite its abandoned and dilapidated state. This reflects how we often see our homes—not just as physical structures, but as cherished sanctuaries. As the story puts it, "One man's hell is another's paradise lost."</p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">The jail serves as a representation of being stuck in an endless repetitive cycle. It is evident that the protagonist has frequently faced imprisonment, as indicated by the line "After all, you always come back". It suggests that the protagonist is unable to escape this pattern, regardless of any attempts to improve or change his situation. This sense of being stuck in a cycle of attempts to make progress but always ending up "back at square one" is relatable to many people. This feeling can be likened to being in jail, feeling stuck and helpless to escape the repetitive cycle.

He starts out homeless and alone, hinting at a past in prison with the line, “Good thing, because in prison you don't get either [personal or financial reference].” At his lowest point, he longs for a better future. The characters in the tower represent his hopes and aspirations. While everyone’s vision of a better life differs, we can all relate to imagining, even for a moment, how things could be better.
